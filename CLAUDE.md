## PRD
The product requierement definition can be found in @PRD.md

## Repository Structure

This is a minimal repository containing only:
- `README.md` - Basic project description
- `LICENSE` - MIT license
- No source code, build files, or configuration files yet

## Development Setup

Currently, there are no build scripts, dependencies, or development tools configured. The repository appears to be in its initial state and would need:
- Language/framework selection and setup
- Build system configuration
- Dependency management
- Source code structure

## Architecture

No code architecture exists yet. The project is intended to provide a WebSocket interface for Claude AI interaction but implementation details are not yet defined.

## Notes for Future Development

When implementing this project, consider:
- WebSocket server implementation language choice
- Client-side interface requirements
- Claude AI API integration approach
- Authentication and security considerations for WebSocket connections

## Code guidelines

- Always use the return early patern.
