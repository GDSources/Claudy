# Development Workflow Documentation
## Git Flow and Test-Driven Development Methodology

This document captures the successful Git workflow and TDD methodology used for the Claudy backend development project.

## Git Flow Strategy

### Branch Structure
```
main (production-ready code)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/websocket-phase3 (PR #1 - Phases 1-3)
â””â”€â”€ feature/claude-code-phase4 (PR #2 - Phases 4-6)
```

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/[component]-phase[n]` - Feature branches for development phases
- Each branch contains logically grouped phases for focused reviews
- Clear descriptive names indicating the primary component being developed

### Commit Strategy
1. **Atomic Commits**: Each commit represents a complete, working phase
2. **Descriptive Messages**: Comprehensive commit messages following this format:
   ```
   Implement Phase X: [Brief description]
   
   - [Detailed bullet points of what was implemented]
   - [Key features and functionality]
   - [Security/testing notes]
   
   [Technical details]: [Architecture/testing info]
   
   ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
   
   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```

### Pull Request Strategy
1. **Grouped Phases**: Combine related phases into logical PR units
   - PR #1: Core infrastructure (Auth, User Management, WebSocket)
   - PR #2: Business logic (Claude Code, File Management, Integration)

2. **Comprehensive PR Descriptions**:
   - Executive summary of all phases included
   - Technical achievements and metrics
   - Test coverage statistics
   - Security implementation details
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Files added/modified
   - PRD requirements mapping

3. **Review While Building**: Create PRs for completed phases while continuing development on subsequent phases

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Methodology

### Core TDD Cycle
```
1. RED â†’ Write failing tests first
2. GREEN â†’ Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. REFACTOR â†’ Improve code while keeping tests passing
4. REPEAT â†’ Continue with next feature/edge case
```

### Phase-Based Development Structure

#### Phase Planning Template
For each phase, define:
1. **Happy Path Tests** (2-3 core scenarios)
2. **Edge Cases & Error Tests** (7-10 comprehensive scenarios)
3. **Implementation Requirements**
4. **Security Requirements**
5. **Integration Points**

#### Test Categories Per Phase
1. **Unit Tests**: Core functionality with mocked dependencies
2. **Integration Tests**: Real database/service interactions
3. **Security Tests**: Authentication, authorization, validation
4. **Concurrency Tests**: Thread safety and race conditions
5. **Error Handling Tests**: Graceful failure scenarios

### Comprehensive Edge Case Coverage

#### Authentication (Phase 1)
- Missing/corrupt signing keys
- Token tampering and expiration
- Malformed tokens and wrong algorithms
- Concurrent token generation
- Invalid user data scenarios

#### User Management (Phase 2)
- Malformed GitHub data
- Duplicate user creation
- Database unavailability
- Concurrent user updates
- Data validation limits

#### WebSocket (Phase 3)
- Unauthenticated connections
- Expired JWT during connection
- Messages before authentication
- Connection drops during auth
- Malformed message handling
- Connection limits enforcement
- Redis failures
- Origin validation
- Graceful shutdown

#### Claude Code Integration (Phase 4)
- Invalid API tokens
- Anthropic API unavailability
- Process spawn failures
- Process crashes
- Resource exhaustion
- Workspace permission errors
- Disk space issues
- Concurrent session conflicts
- Encryption key failures

#### File Management (Phase 5)
- File size limit exceeded
- Malicious content detection
- Invalid encoding
- Nonexistent workspace
- Disk space failures
- Concurrent file operations
- Filesystem corruption
- Cleanup failures

#### Integration Testing (Phase 6)
- Database failover scenarios
- Redis failover scenarios
- Network partition recovery
- Resource exhaustion recovery
- Concurrent user sessions at scale
- Graceful shutdown procedures
- Corrupted session data
- End-to-end authentication flows

### Subagent Development Pattern

#### Subagent Task Template
```markdown
I need you to implement Phase X of the [component] system for [project].

Context: [Previous phases completed, current system state]

Your task is to implement comprehensive [component] with test-driven development:

**Tests to implement (all in [file path]):**

Happy Path Tests:
1. [Test name] - [Description]
2. [Test name] - [Description]

Edge Cases & Error Tests:
3. [Test name] - [Description]
[... 7-10 edge cases]

**Implementation requirements:**
- [Specific technical requirements]
- Follow TDD: Write failing tests first, then implement minimal code to pass
- Handle all error cases gracefully without panics
- [Security/integration requirements]

**Key behaviors to test:**
- [Specific behaviors and scenarios]

Create the test files first, run them to see failures, then implement [component] to make all tests pass.

Return a summary of what was implemented and the test results.
```

#### Subagent Workflow
1. **Delegate Complete Phases**: Give subagents entire phases, not partial work
2. **Provide Full Context**: Include PRD requirements, previous phase context
3. **Specify Test Requirements**: Exact number and types of tests needed
4. **Require TDD Process**: Explicit instruction to write tests first
5. **Demand Comprehensive Coverage**: Both happy path and edge cases
6. **Request Summary Reports**: Standardized reporting of implementation and results

### Testing Infrastructure

#### Mock Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Mock all external dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Use real databases with test containers
- **Consistent Interfaces**: Design for easy mocking and testing

#### Test Container Usage
```go
// MongoDB Test Container
mongoContainer, _ := mongodb.RunContainer(ctx, 
    testcontainers.WithImage("mongo:7.0"),
    mongodb.WithUsername("testuser"),
    mongodb.WithPassword("testpass"),
)

// Redis Test Container  
redisContainer, _ := redis.RunContainer(ctx,
    testcontainers.WithImage("redis:7.0-alpine"),
)
```

#### Performance Benchmarking
- Include benchmark tests for critical operations
- Measure response times, memory usage, and throughput
- Validate against PRD performance requirements

### Quality Gates

#### Before Committing
1. All tests pass (100% success rate)
2. No panics or unhandled errors
3. Security requirements validated
4. Performance benchmarks met
5. Integration tests with real dependencies pass

#### Before Creating PR
1. Comprehensive test coverage documented
2. Security implementation validated
3. Performance metrics included
4. Documentation updated
5. Clean commit history

#### PR Review Checklist
1. Test coverage analysis
2. Security review
3. Performance validation
4. Code quality assessment
5. Integration testing verification
