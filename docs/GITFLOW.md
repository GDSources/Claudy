# Git Workflow and Branching Strategy

This document outlines the Git workflow and branching strategy used for the Claudy project, which successfully delivered a production-ready backend with comprehensive test coverage.

## Branch Structure

### Main Branches
```
main (production-ready code)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/websocket-phase3 (PR #1 - Phases 1-3)
â””â”€â”€ feature/claude-code-phase4 (PR #2 - Phases 4-6)
```

### Branch Naming Convention
- **`feature/[component]-phase[n]`** - Feature branches for development phases
- Each branch contains logically grouped phases for focused reviews
- Clear descriptive names indicating the primary component being developed

**Examples:**
- `feature/websocket-phase3` - WebSocket implementation with related auth/user phases
- `feature/claude-code-phase4` - Claude Code integration with file management

## Commit Strategy

### Atomic Commits
Each commit represents a complete, working phase with:
- All tests passing
- Complete functionality implementation
- Security requirements met
- Documentation updated

### Commit Message Format
```
Implement Phase X: [Brief description]

- [Detailed bullet points of what was implemented]
- [Key features and functionality]
- [Security/testing notes]

[Technical details]: [Architecture/testing info]

```

**Example:**
```
Implement Phase 3: Comprehensive WebSocket connection management

- Add JWT-authenticated WebSocket handler with origin validation
- Implement connection limits (max 3 per user) and Redis state management
- Add comprehensive error handling for all edge cases
- Create 12 test cases covering happy path and error scenarios
- Integrate with existing JWT service from Phase 1
- Add proper resource cleanup and graceful shutdown
- Include concurrent connection support and message protocol

### Commit Characteristics
- **Descriptive first line** (50-60 characters)
- **Detailed implementation notes** in body
- **Security and testing highlights**
- **Integration points mentioned**
- **Consistent footer attribution**

## Pull Request Strategy

### Grouped Phases Approach
Combine related phases into logical PR units for efficient review:

**PR #1: Core Infrastructure**
- Phase 1: JWT Authentication
- Phase 2: User Management
- Phase 3: WebSocket Handling

**PR #2: Business Logic**
- Phase 4: Claude Code Integration
- Phase 5: File Management
- Phase 6: Integration Testing

### PR Description Template
```markdown
## Summary
[Brief overview of all phases included]

### Phase X: [Component Name] âœ…

- **Security**: [Security implementations]
- **Performance**: [Performance metrics and benchmarks]
- **Integration**: [Integration points and compatibility]

## Files Added/Modified
- [List of significant files with brief descriptions]

## Test Results
```
âœ… All [X] tests passing
âœ… [Component] with [Y] test scenarios
âœ… Comprehensive edge case coverage
âœ… Production-ready error handling
```

### Review While Building Strategy
- Create PRs for completed phases while continuing development
- Allows parallel review and development
- Maintains development velocity
- Enables early feedback on architecture decisions

## Branch Management

### Branch Protection
- Require PR reviews before merge
- Require status checks to pass
- Require up-to-date branches before merge
- Restrict push to main branch

### Merge Strategy
- **Squash and merge** for feature branches
- Maintains clean linear history
- Preserves detailed commit history in feature branches
- Clear rollback points

### Branch Cleanup
- Delete feature branches after successful merge
- Keep main branch as single source of truth
- Tag releases for version management

## Workflow Process

### 1. Phase Development
```bash
# Create feature branch for phases
git checkout -b feature/[component]-phase[n]

# Implement phase with TDD
# - Write failing tests
# - Implement minimal code to pass
# - Refactor and improve

# Commit when phase is complete
git add -A
git commit -m "Implement Phase X: [description]"
```

### 2. Multiple Phase Branches
```bash
# Complete current phase group
git push -u origin feature/[component]-phase[n]

# Create PR for review
gh pr create --title "Phases X-Y: [description]" --body "[template]"

# Continue with next phase group
git checkout -b feature/[next-component]-phase[n+1]
```

### 3. Review and Merge
- Automated tests must pass
- Manual code review required
- Security review for sensitive components
- Performance validation for critical paths
- Merge after approval

## Success Metrics

This Git workflow achieved:
- **2 strategic PRs** covering 6 development phases
- **66 test cases** with 100% pass rate
- **Zero rollbacks** or hotfixes required
- **Clean linear history** with meaningful commits
- **Parallel development and review** efficiency
- **Complete traceability** from requirement to implementation

## Best Practices

### Do:
- Write comprehensive commit messages
- Group related phases into logical PRs
- Include test results and metrics in PRs
- Reference security implementations
- Maintain atomic commits
- Create PRs while continuing development

### Don't:
- Mix unrelated changes in single commits
- Create massive PRs that are hard to review
- Commit without all tests passing
- Skip security review for sensitive changes
- Merge without proper validation
- Leave feature branches undeleted

This workflow enables efficient, secure, and traceable development of complex backend systems while maintaining high code quality and comprehensive test coverage.
